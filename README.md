# Leon Agency – HTML & CSS Practice Project

This is a simple front-end practice project built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Font Awesome**, following the instructions and tutorials of **Osama Elzero** on YouTube.

The goal of this project was to strengthen my fundamentals in layout, responsiveness, and clean UI structure using only HTML and CSS.

## 📌 About the Project

Leon Agency is a fictional design agency template from Graphberry.  
In this project, I recreated the full landing page and UI using pure HTML and CSS, focusing on:

- Proper page structure  
- Clean and reusable CSS  
- Responsive design  
- Dropdown menu using CSS only  
- Flexbox & Grid layout techniques  
- Simple typography & spacing rules  
- Font Awesome icons integration  

This project represents an early stage in my journey in front-end development.
